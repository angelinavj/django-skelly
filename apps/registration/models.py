    out accounts which have never been activated.

        Key expiration is determined by a two-step process:
        
        1. If the user has already activated, the key will have been
           reset to the string constant ``ACTIVATED``. Re-activating
           is not permitted, and so this method returns ``True`` in

           days after signup during which a user is allowed to

        ``registration/activation_email.txt``

        These templates will each receive the following context
        variables:

        ``activation_key``
            The activation key for the new account.

        ``expiration_days``
            The number of days remaining during which the account may
            be activated.

        ``site``
            An object representing the site on which the user
            registered; depending on whether ``django.contrib.sites``
